- 👋 Hi, I’m @AtahanAliAyranci
- 👀 I’m interested in working with python projects. I have done HTML and CSS before but I quit.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python. I have not finished any courses but I get help from the internet either way 
plus making projects are more fun and you learn better in my opinion. I was learning Java at one point but I quit 
because python is the better alternative for AI, machine learning and stuff like that.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any python project. If you want I can try other stuff. Keep in mind that I am still a newbie and have a lot to learn.
- 📫 How to reach me: I don't know if you are able to reach me from here because im new but I do have a snapchat account that you could write to. @aliatahanayranc
